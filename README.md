# Bachelor-Thesis

The Code in this repository was created within my Bachelor's Thesis on the topic "Investigating Emotional Valence-Arousal Interactions in Behavioural and Attentional Responses Using an Approach-Avoidance Paradigm". 

Files within the Preprocessing-and-Descriptive-Plots folder are written in Python (version 3.11).
Files within the Statistical-and-Exploratory-Analysis folder are written in R (version 4.4.2). 

All the data and the ReadMe texts in 'Preparation_Behavioural_Data.ipynb' and 'Preparation_Eyetracking_Data.ipynb' were provided by Aitana Grasso Cladera.
